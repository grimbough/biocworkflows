    "Introduction\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a popular technique for identifying the genomic binding sites of a target protein. Conventional analyses of ChIP-seq data aim to detect absolute binding (i.e., the presence or absence of a binding sites) based on peaks in the read coverage. However, a number of recent studies have focused on the detection of changes in the binding profile between conditions (Ross-Innes et al. 2012; Pal et al. 2013). These differential binding (DB) analyses involve counting reads into genomic intervals, and then testing those counts for significant differences between conditions. This defines a set of putative DB regions for further examination. DB analyses are easier to perform than their conventional counterparts, as the effect of genomic biases is largely mitigated when counts for different libraries are compared at the same genomic region. DB regions may also be more relevant as the change in binding can be associated with the biological difference between conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key step in the DB analysis is the manner in which reads are counted. The most obvious strategy is to count reads into pre-defined regions of interest, like promoters or gene bodies (Pal et al. 2013). This is simple but will not capture changes outside of those regions. In contrast, *de novo* analyses do not depend on pre-specified regions, instead using empirically defined peaks or sliding windows for read counting. Peak-based methods are implemented in the *[DiffBind](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DiffBind)* and *[DBChIP](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DBChIP)* software packages (Ross-Innes et al. 2012; Liang and Keles 2012), which count reads into peak intervals that have been identified with software like MACS (Zhang et al. 2008). This requires some care to maintain statistical rigour, as peaks are called with the same data used to test for DB. Alternatively, window-based approaches count reads into sliding windows across the genome. This is a more direct strategy that avoids problems with data re-use and can provide increased DB detection power (Lun and Smyth 2014). However, its correct implementation is not straightforward due to the subtleties with interpretation of the false discovery rate (FDR).\n",
    "\n",
    "This article describes a computational workflow for performing a DB analysis with sliding windows. The aim is to facilitate the practical implementation of window-based DB analyses by providing detailed code and expected output. The workflow described here applies to any ChIP-seq experiment with multiple experimental conditions and with multiple biological samples within one or more of the conditions. It detects and summarizes DB regions between conditions in a *de novo* manner, i.e., without making any prior assumptions about the location or width of bound regions. Detected regions are then annotated according to their proximity to annotated genes. In addition, the code can be easily adapted to accommodate batch effects, covariates and multiple experimental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project (Huber et al. 2015). It contains all steps that are necessary for detecting DB regions, starting from the raw read sequences. Reads are first aligned to the genome using the *[Rsubread](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rsubread)* package (Liao, Smyth, and Shi 2013). These are counted into sliding windows with *[csaw](http://bioconductor.org/packages/csaw)*, to quantify binding intensity across the genome (Lun and Smyth 2014; Lun and Smyth 2015). Statistical modelling is based on the negative binomial (NB) distribution with generalized linear models (GLMs) in the *[edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/edgeR)* package (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010; McCarthy, Chen, and Smyth 2012), with additional sophistication provided by quasi-likelihood (QL) methods (Lund et al. 2012). Code is also provided for filtering, normalization and region-level control of the FDR. Finally, annotation and visualization of the DB regions is described using *[Gviz](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Gviz)* and other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of the methods in this article will be demonstrated on two publicly available ChIP-seq data sets. The first data set studies changes in H3K9ac marking between pro-B and mature B cells (Revilla-I-Domingo et al. 2012). The second data set studies changes in CREB-binding protein (CBP) binding between wild-type and CBP knock-out cells (Kasper et al. 2014). These two studies were chosen to represent common situations where a DB analysis can be applied -- one involving sharp binding with CBP, and the other involving broader marking with H3K9ac. A separate workflow is described for the analysis of each data set, using the sliding window approach in both cases but with different parameter settings. The intention is to provide readers with a variety of usage examples from which they can construct DB analyses of their own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aligning reads in the H3K9ac libraries\n",
    "======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to download the relevant ChIP-seq libraries from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Edgar, Domrachev, and Lash 2002). These are obtained from the data series GSE38046, using the Sequence Read Accession (SRA) numbers listed below. The experiment contains two biological replicates in total for each of the two cell types, i.e., pro-B and mature B. Multiple technical replicates exist for some of the biological replicates, and are indicated as those files with the same `grouping`."

The spacing between windows is set to the default of 50 bp, i.e., the start positions for adjacent windows are 50 bp apart. Smaller spacings can be used to improve spatial resolution, but will increase memory usage and runtime by increasing the number of windows required to cover the genome. This is unnecessary as increased resolution confers little practical benefit for this data set -- counts for very closely spaced windows will be practically identical.

In contrast, `detailRanges` will report all overlapping features for a region as a single string, i.e., each input region has one output value.

All windows overlapping each promoter are defined as a cluster, and DB statistics are computed as previously described for each cluster/promoter.

More binding in one condition means that more reads are sequenced at the binding sites, leaving fewer reads for the rest of the genome. This suppresses the genomic coverage at non-DB sites, resulting in spurious differences between libraries. To remove this bias, reads are counted into large genomic bins. Most bins are assumed to represent non-DB background regions. Any systematic differences in the coverage of those bins is attributed to composition bias and is normalized out. Specifically, the TMM method (Robinson and Oshlack 2010) is applied to compute normalization factors from the bin counts. These factors can then be applied to the DB analysis with the window counts."
